The House Party Protocol, Sir?

This is a pharse coined by Tony Stark in Iron Man 3. This project
hopes to be the Android client for a larger umbrella project: a
virtual assistant inspired in JARVIS.


Usage
=====

There is not much to use yet, but the application implements the
[VoiceInteractionSessionService][api] needed for using the contextual
Assist API in Android.

  [api]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/voice/VoiceInteractionSessionService.html


Requirements
============

This app uses gradle as its dependency management system, so just use
`./gradlew` to run the commands.
